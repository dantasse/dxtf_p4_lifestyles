<p>Jim: Phil, this is Jim from your property at 342 Belmont. Sorry to say I've got an issue with the hydrogen lines; they seem to be only filling my scooter at half speed.</p>

<p>Phil: Okay, Jim. I'll send someone out to look at it.</p>

<p>(a week passes)</p>

<p>Jim: Phil, when's someone coming to fix the hydrogen feed?</p>

<p>Phil: Uh, tomorrow.</p>

<p>Jim: Okay.</p>

<p>(two days pass)</p>

<p>Jim: Phil, what's the deal? The hydrogen station is still only half speed.</p>

<p>Phil: Well, what's wrong with that?</p>

<p>Jim: What do you mean, what's wrong with that? It's not working! It says in the lease that there's a hydrogen charger included with the apartment.</p>

<p>Phil: Just refill it overnight! What does it matter if it takes 2 hours or 4 hours?</p>

<p>Jim: I can't do that. I need to charge it midday.</p>

<p>Phil: Well, look. The lease never says there's a high speed hydrogen charger included.</p>

<p>Jim: Hey, I want our relationship to work out here. I'm guessing you do too.</p>

<p>Phil: Is that a threat? What are you going to do, anonymously rep-poison me on Leasenet? This isn't the teens, you can't just throw out some slander and turn away renters. Reputation Web works for a reason.</p>

<p>Jim: Calm down, Phil. I'm not talking about anything drastic. I just need to be able to get around.</p>

<p>Phil: Right, right. Yeah, sorry. It's just that property taxes have been going up again and I'm geting squeezed a bit, and the damn hydrogen techs are so pricey. Plus, you've got to hire them all through the giant hydrogen corporations, and they add 20% on top.</p>

<p>Jim: Yeah, I see. I can hold out a couple days - I don't have another shift couriering for Speedthings until Thursday.</p>

<p>Phil: Wait, you deliver for Speedthings?</p>

<p>Jim: Well, I courier. Yeah.</p>

<p>Phil: Oh man, I love Speedthings. They've saved my ass a hundred times, getting me tools or documents or something, and they're always super friendly too.</p>

<p>Jim: Good deal. Hah, guess I haven't had a route to your place yet. Course, based on this conversation, they'll probably make sure to get you on my schedule. So I guess, see you around Thursday. Hah.</p>

<p>Phil: Fair enough. And if you need to borrow an electric scooter in the meantime, my buddy's got an extra one he doesn't use. At least you can fix your damn electric bike yourself. Anyway, just give me a call.</p>

<p>Jim: Thanks, Phil. </p>
