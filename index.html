<h2>Area: Bloomfield (15224)</h2>

<h3>Current reality:</h3>

<p>(from <a href="http://zipatlas.com/us/pa/pittsburgh/zip-15224.htm">zipatlas</a>)
Population: 12095. 45% male, 55% female. Age distribution is a little younger than Pennsylvania, median=36.3 years.</p>

<p>Racially: 63% white, 30% black, 2% asian, 1% hispanic. More black people, proportionally, than Pennsylvania and the US. There are large German, Irish, and Polish populations, though the largest group (19%) is Italian.</p>

<p>Education: of 8347 adults, 32% have high school diploma, 16% have some college, 6% associates, 11% bachelors, 9% graduate degree. These are all slightly lower than the national average.</p>

<p>Employment: numbers are hard to understand. It looks like the unemployment level is about 6%, close to the Pennyslvania and national average. 34% are in professional/management, 23% service occupations, 26% in sales/office, 6% in construction, and 9% in production/transportation. Education, health, and social services is the biggest employer.</p>

<p>Income: Median household income is low, at $22,880. Average household size is 2.13, compared to the nation's 2.58. This may have something to do with students and young professionals. </p>

<p>Commuting: 44% drive alone, 12% carpool, 22% take public transportation, 18% walk. Way more walkers and public transport takers than the national average.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://ucsur.pitt.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PittsburghACS_200610_February2012.pdf">Pittsburgh American Community Survey 5-year estimates</a>, via Pitt's UCSUR:</p>

<p>Population: 9,003 (not including Garfield, as zipatlas did)</p>

<p>Racially: 84% white, 8% black, 5% Asian</p>

<p>Education/income/commuting: similar to the above.</p>

<p>Place of birth: 68% born in Pennsylvania, 19% born in another state, 10% foreign born.</p>

<p>Age: not a lot of young people &lt;18 (9%). Population seems to be slowly aging, 14% >65.</p>

<h3>Chosen demographic in 2054: aging Italian-American adult.</h3>

<p>75 year old Italian man, who owned a small tanning salon and some rental properties as a 35-year-old in 2014. Some college at Pitt, but didn't finish. Household income is higher than the average in Bloomfield, which he attributes to his hustle (managing a business and being a landlord is no easy work).</p>

<h3>Forces affecting his life:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Increased immigration and rising house prices: is great for him in theory, as he invested early and bought a lot of houses. In reality, he hasn't been able to take advantage of it much yet, as he hasn't been selling, and his houses are not in the best condition. However, rising property values bring rising rents, which have been nice.</li>
<li>CMU, Google, and the tech scene's continued expansion and influence: more students and young professionals are moving in, which means it's always been easy to find renters. However, they've been growing increasingly demanding as they've been paying more rent.</li>
<li>Shrinking Italian representation in Bloomfield - as adults grow old and die, fewer Italian immigrants replace them, so the neighborhood is losing its "Little Italy" feel. He's somewhat sad about this, as he has fond memories of his parents and grandparents playing Bocce at their social club and playing music at Little Italy days, but he's overall a practical guy and doesn't get caught up in too much sentimentality.</li>
<li>Continued bus cuts and transit difficulties. Doesn't affect him much, as he walks to work (like 18% of the neighborhood). Increased bicycling has eased traffic congestion, so it's easier to get around when he does want to drive somewhere.</li>
<li>Rising health consciousness: forced him to shut down his tanning salon when he was 53. Nobody came there anymore, citing health concerns.</li>
<li>Rising health care costs: have been a concern for him as he's aged. The price of being old has gone up, which is why he's still a landlord at 75. Due to his housing equity, he's not worried about growing old, but he wanted to leave a bunch of money for his kids, and he's not sure he'll be able to. Of course, increased estate taxes have made this even more difficult.</li>
<li>Availability of continuing education: he was able to take some financial management courses online, which helped him make more money on his houses.</li>
<li>Increasing professionalism of local businesses: as more hotels and national businesses have moved into the neighborhood, the carpenters and repair workers have gone out of business, replaced by larger contractors. This has been disruptive, as he's relied on his network for a while, but they are unavailable now.</li>
<li>Climate change: has not affected him directly, but indirectly made a lot of his life harder. Prices for fuel went up, winters are a little colder, summers a little warmer. Pittsburgh is pretty well located to avoid the worst. They did have a hurricane when he was 58, that was a new one.</li>
<li>Increasing cost of education: private school education has become ridiculously expensive. State schools have still done well though, so both his kids went to Penn State.</li>
</ul>
